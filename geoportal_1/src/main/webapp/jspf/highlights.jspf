		Welcome to the new FGDL! We are happy to announce that as of 11/4/2014 we are live with a limited amount of data layers. We will be adding data and making updates regularly.
		The FGDL Metadata Explorer will remain up and running during this transition. Please zoom in and pan around with the map and/or enter search terms to begin discovering our geospatial data.
